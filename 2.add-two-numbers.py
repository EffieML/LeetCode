# Testcase Example:  '[2,4,3]\n[5,6,4]'
#
# You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative
# integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes
# contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sumÂ as a linked
# list.
#
# You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the
# number 0 itself.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
# Output: [7,0,8]
# Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
# Output: [0]
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
# Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
# 0 <= Node.val <= 9
# It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading
# zeros.
#
#
#

# @lc code=start
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

# iterate once, just add the 2 list, if sum is bigger than 10, store the 10th as carry for the next iteration
# 1. create dummy node, set as curr, set carry =0
# 2. if l1 or l2 or carry exist, then we can add them
# 3. use result to calculate new carry and new val, and created new List Node
# 4. update pointers for l1, l2 and new sum list, as move all nodes in the lists to next location, keep doing the iteration
# T= O(n), M=O(n)

class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: Optional[ListNode], l2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:

        dummy = ListNode()
        curr = dummy
        carry = 0
        while l1 or l2 or carry:
            v1 = l1.val if l1 else 0
            v2 = l2.val if l2 else 0
            # compute new digit
            val = v1+v2+carry
            # calculate new carry and new val
            carry = val // 10  # floor division -15//2= -8
            val = val % 10
            curr.next = ListNode(val)
            # update pointers for l1, l2 and sum list to the next
            curr = curr.next
            l1 = l1.next if l1 else None
            l2 = l2.next if l2 else None
        return dummy.next
